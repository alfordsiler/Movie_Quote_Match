###Movie Quote Match: How to play

####After pressing the start button, the timer will begin counting down and a movie quote will appear and you will hear the clip (if you have sound on). You will have to click on the picture below of the character who says the line.

####You earn a point if you click the correct character.

####Once you choose a character, you will not be able to select that one again, so if you are unsure, you might want to use the SKIP button to keep more options available.

####However, if you use SKIP, you cannot go back.

####Player 1 will play the full round, then Player 2. Whoever has the highest score wins. Duh. 

####f you need a hint, hover over the picture and you will see a bit of the clip.
